          “Design will save the world.” That’s why we became designers — the
          yearning for having a positive impact, shaping our surroundings, and
          designing a better tomorrow. It’s a knack we have: to think about the
          future and how to get there. Lately, we lost focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Design has been misused as a tool for manipulation, trickery, and
          freedom wearing. Facebook, Google, and most of the tech industry
          easily fall under this umbrella. Dark patterns: “a user interface that
          has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as
          buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring
          bills”
          <sup
            ><a
              href="#fn1-28894"
              id="fnr1-28894"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >1</a
            ></sup
          >
          became so ubiquitous that they’re used without consideration of their
          impact. How many apps did you use today which have an infinite scroll?
          How many notifications did you receive this morning and how many were
          needed?
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where ethics is finding its place in design. “Ethics doesn’t
          distinguish between right or wrong. Rather, it guides people to a
          preferable future, universally.”<sup
            ><a
              href="#fn2-28894"
              id="fnr2-28894"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >2</a
            ></sup
          >. It becomes the constant questioning and alignment of intention; the
          reminder that what we create has an impact. Every decision we make,
          whether we intend it or not, affects those we’re designing for. Take
          the example of the infinite scroll: it makes people spend more time in
          your app - but at the expense of what? Perhaps sleep deprivation and
          social exclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn’t need to be that way: a lot of companies, designers, and
          developers are laudably proving that every day. And it’s not just
          about ethics — its good business:
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Apple</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Privacy as the main competitive advantage.</strong> It’s in
          every product, their advertising, and website: Apple’s new business
          model is not subscriptions, it’s privacy. Why? It’s good for people,
          and it’s one of the most challenging things for their competitors to
          copy as it would mean a complete change of business models.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Are.na</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Transparency from the ground up.</strong> If you haven’t heard
          of <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> please go check them out! Fast
          Company said about are.na that “In the groundswell of anger and
          suspicion toward social media platforms, Are.na feels like a necessary
          antidote.”<sup
            ><a
              href="#fn3-28894"
              id="fnr3-28894"

          air - see their transparent roadmap

        </p>

        <h3><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Google without the evil.</strong>‌ Also, another proof that
          you can run a successful tech company while doing things the right
          way. Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo founder, said: “Our vision is to set
          a new standard of trust online. The Internet shouldn&#8217;t feel so
          creepy and getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple
          as closing the blinds.”. Read more about their business model

        <h3><strong>Monzo</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <strong>A new type of bank.</strong>‌ With their transparency page,
          Monzo is showing the way on how to build trust, and be accountable for
          their actions. See more

        <h2>Everything interconnects:</h2>

        <p>
          These examples show us that it’s possible. Now let’s get started! As
          designers, we were taught to design with people at heart. We should
          remember that. However, we shouldn’t forget that people have a place
          in society, the environment, and business. Embrace complexity. We
          can’t design in the vacuum.
        </p>

        <p>
          To help us do that, we’ve started developing a new design critique
          tool. It helps us be mindful about the potential impact and to ideate
          around possible solutions to the challenges we identify. Here’s a
          snapshot of the framework:
        </p>

        <img
          alt="Four areas of the design impact board: people, business, society, and environment."
          class="article-image"
          src="img/ethics-asset.jpg"
        />

        <p>
          Start by gathering the team to talk impact. Take a project you’re
          working on, have worked, or are about to start. Give a short explainer
          on what problems you’re trying to solve and how you’re answering them.
          Then map those solutions to their impact in each one of the verticals
          in the template. Ask yourself: what are the things you designed that
          can impact people, the environment, society, and business in a
          positive way? And negatively?
        </p>

        <p>
          Take the example of a transportation service (like Uber or Lift). Your
          system might look something like:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <h4>People:</h4>

          <p>
            <strong>Positive impact</strong>: convenient and quick access to a
            ride for users and a new income source for drivers. <br />
            <strong>Negative impact</strong>: unregulated work, might lead to
            insecurity in rides, and loss of worker’s rights.
          </p>

          <h4>Business:</h4>

          <p>
            <strong>Positive impact</strong>: working as a transportation
            platform with a clear use-case, for users and workers, allows for an
            easily scalable solution.
          </p>

          <h4>Society:</h4>

          <p>
            <strong>Negative impact</strong>: More congested roads, slower
            traffic, and more city space taken from people.
          </p>

          <h4>Environment:</h4>

          <p>
            <strong>Negative impact</strong>: the business incentive is to put
            more cars on the streets to enable quick access, causing more noise
            and pollution in our cities.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When you’re done, you should have a clearer picture of the impact your
          design is having. Is there anything you can add, change, or remove, to
          make the overall system more positive? To balance the disparities?
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it as an always-evolving picture. Have it nearby, make sure
          to update it, and don’t stop questioning how to make the system
          better.
        </p>

        <h3>What next?</h3>

        <p>
          We know this won’t be the solution to all problems. However, we
          believe that being mindful of our decisions is a good place to start.
