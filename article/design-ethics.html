          “Design will save the world.” That’s why we became designers — the
          yearning for having a positive impact, shaping our surroundings, and
          designing a better tomorrow. It’s a knack we have: to think about the
          future and how to get there. Lately, however, we lost focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Design has been misused as a tool for manipulation, trickery, and
          freedom wearing. Facebook, Google, and most of the tech industry
          easily fall under this umbrella. Dark patterns
          <sup
            ><a
              href="#fn1-16466"
              id="fnr1-16466"
              title="see footnote"

          >
          became so ubiquitous that they’re used without consideration of their
          impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where ethics is finding its place in design. “Ethics doesn’t
          distinguish between right or wrong. Rather, it guides people to a
          preferable future, universally.”<sup
            ><a
              href="#fn2-16466"
              id="fnr2-16466"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >2</a
            ></sup
          >. It becomes the constant questioning and alignment of intention; the
          reminder that what we create has an impact. Every decision we make,
          whether we intend it or not, affects those we’re designing for. Take
          the example of an infinite scroll: it makes people spend more time in
          your app - but at the expense of what? Perhaps sleep deprivation and
          social exclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn’t need to be that way. And, a lot of companies, designers,
          and developers are laudably proving that every day. And it’s not just
          about ethics — its good business:
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Apple</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <em>Privacy as the main competitive advantage.</em> It’s in every
          product, their advertising, and website: Apple’s new business model is
          not subscriptions, it’s privacy. Why? It’s good for people, and it’s
          one of the most challenging things for their competitors to copy as it
          would mean a complete change of business models.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Are.na</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <em>Transparency from the ground up.</em> If you haven’t heard of
          <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> please go check them out! Fast
          Company said about are.na that “In the groundswell of anger and
          suspicion toward social media platforms, Are.na feels like a necessary
          antidote.”<sup
            ><a
              href="#fn3-16466"
              id="fnr3-16466"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >3</a

          air - see their transparent roadmap

        </p>

        <h3><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <em>Google without the evil.</em>‌ And another proof that you can run
          a successful tech company while doing things the right way. Gabriel
          Weinberg, DuckDuckGo founder, said: “Our vision is to set a new
          standard of trust online. The Internet shouldn&#8217;t feel so creepy
          and getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple as
          closing the blinds.”. Read more about their business model

        <h2>Everything interconnects - ethics as a system:</h2>

        <p>
          These examples show us that it’s possible. Now we just need to get
          started. As designers, we were taught to design with people at heart.
          We should remember that. But, we shouldn’t forget that people have a
          place in society, the environment, and business. Embrace complexity.
          We can’t design in the vacuum.
        </p>

        <p>
          To help us do that, we’ve started developing a new design critique
          tool. It helps us be mindful about the potential impact and to ideate
          around possible solutions to the challenges we identify. Here’s a
          snapshot of the framework:
        </p>

        <p><strong>ADD IMAGE HERE</strong></p>

        <p>
          Start by gathering the team to talk ethics. Take a project you’re
          working on, have worked, or are about to start. Give a short explainer
          on what problems you’re trying to solve and how you’re answering them.
          When you’re done, map those solutions to their impact in each one of
          the verticals in the template. Ask yourself: what are the things you
          designed that can impact people, the environment, society, and
          business in a positive way? And negatively? Is there anything you can
          add, change, or remove, to make the overall system more positive? To
          balance the disparities?
        </p>

        <p>
          When you’re done, you should have a clearer picture of the impact your
          design is having. Think of it as an always-evolving picture. Have it
          nearby, make sure to update it, and don’t stop questioning how to make
          the system better.
        </p>

        <h3>What next?</h3>

        <p>
          We know this won’t be the solution to all problems. But we believe
          that being mindful of our decisions is a good place to start.
        </p>

          suggestions, or want to share how you’re tackling these issues –
