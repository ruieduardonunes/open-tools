          “Design will save the world.” That’s why we became designers — the
          yearning for having a positive impact, shaping our surroundings, and
          designing a better tomorrow. It’s a knack we have: to think about the
          future and how to get there. Lately, however, we lost focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Design has been misused as a tool for manipulation, trickery, and
          freedom wearing. Facebook, Google, and most of the tech industry
          easily fall under this umbrella. Dark patterns
          <sup
            ><a
              href="#fn1-28894"
              id="fnr1-28894"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >1</a
            ></sup
          >
          became so ubiquitous that they’re used without consideration of their
          impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where ethics is finding its place in design. “Ethics doesn’t
          distinguish between right or wrong. Rather, it guides people to a
          preferable future, universally.”<sup
            ><a
              href="#fn2-28894"
              id="fnr2-28894"
              title="see footnote"
              class="footnote"
              >2</a
            ></sup
          >. It becomes the constant questioning and alignment of intention; the
          reminder that what we create has an impact. Every decision we make,
          whether we intend it or not, affects those we’re designing for. Take
          the example of an infinite scroll: it makes people spend more time in
          your app - but at the expense of what? Perhaps sleep deprivation and
          social exclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn’t need to be that way: a lot of companies, designers, and
          developers are laudably proving that every day. And it’s not just
          about ethics — its good business:
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Apple</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <em>Privacy as the main competitive advantage.</em> It’s in every
          product, their advertising, and website: Apple’s new business model is
          not subscriptions, it’s privacy. Why? It’s good for people, and it’s
          one of the most challenging things for their competitors to copy as it
          would mean a complete change of business models.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Are.na</strong></h3>

        <p>
          <em>Transparency from the ground up.</em> If you haven’t heard of
          <a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> please go check them out! Fast
          Company said about are.na that “In the groundswell of anger and
          suspicion toward social media platforms, Are.na feels like a necessary
          antidote.”<sup

          <em>Google without the evil.</em>‌ Also, another proof that you can
          run a successful tech company while doing things the right way.
          Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo founder, said: “Our vision is to set a
          new standard of trust online. The Internet shouldn&#8217;t feel so
          creepy and getting the privacy you deserve online should be as simple
          as closing the blinds.”. Read more about their business model

        <h2>Everything interconnects - ethics as a system:</h2>

        <p>
          These examples show us that it’s possible. Now let’s get started! As
          designers, we were taught to design with people at heart. We should
          remember that. However, we shouldn’t forget that people have a place
          in society, the environment, and business. Embrace complexity. We
          can’t design in the vacuum.
        </p>

        <p>
          To help us do that, we’ve started developing a new design critique
          tool. It helps us be mindful about the potential impact and to ideate
          around possible solutions to the challenges we identify. Here’s a
          snapshot of the framework:
        </p>

        <img
          alt="Four areas of the ethics design system: people, business, society, and environment."
          class="article-image"
          src="img/ethics-asset.jpeg"
        />

        <p>
          Start by gathering the team to talk ethics. Take a project you’re
          working on, have worked, or are about to start. Give a short explainer
          on what problems you’re trying to solve and how you’re answering them.
          Then map those solutions to their impact in each one of the verticals
          in the template. Ask yourself: what are the things you designed that
          can impact people, the environment, society, and business in a
          positive way? And negatively? Is there anything you can add, change,
          or remove, to make the overall system more positive? To balance the
          disparities?
        </p>

        <p>
          When you’re done, you should have a clearer picture of the impact your
          design is having. Think of it as an always-evolving picture. Have it
          nearby, make sure to update it, and don’t stop questioning how to make
          the system better.
        </p>

        <h3>What next?</h3>

        <p>
          We know this won’t be the solution to all problems. However, we
          believe that being mindful of our decisions is a good place to start.
